# JavaScript Learning - Josh Higginson - 2021

This repo is a combination of the studies I have been doing over the 2021 Christmas Holiday period.

It contains a number of teachings from the following sources:

- MDN

- W3Schools

- Learn With Mosh
  
- codeaddict / John Smilga

- Fireship

I hope that this solid foundation will enable me to develop some killer React-Native cross platform applications over 2022.
